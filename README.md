# Programming Challenges

-These challenges coincide with the [Programming Challenges Book] (http://acm.cs.buap.mx/downloads/Programming_Challenges.pdf)

-All Solutions that are uploaded have been accepted by the [UVA Judge] (onlinejudge.org)

-Even though I try to write these solutions as elegantly as possible with organization at the forefront, sometimes it can get messy. I will try to always come back, if not now, maybe in the future, and rewrite/organize these solutions.
